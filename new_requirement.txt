To make sure everything fits the real purpose of the app, here are the points that need to be adjusted:

1. Switch the focus from nature scenes to Instagram-style concepts
The app is meant for generating casual Instagram-like photos of a person. Not landscapes and not professional studio shoots. Think of everyday social media vibes like cafe aesthetics, mirror selfies, rooftop shots, travel moments, street style, gym looks, and casual portraits.

2. Introduce pre-selectable scenes
The main idea is that users can pick from ready themes that match those Instagram concepts. These scenes should feel like realistic settings a person would normally post.

3. Keep the custom prompt option
Custom prompts are fine to keep as an alternative input. They just shouldn’t be the primary feature. The Focus is on selecting Scenes/themes (e.g. cafe shots, rooftop moments, gym fits, mirror selfies, street style).

4. Adjust the generation prompt style
The output should look like a casual Instagram photo taken on a phone. Not overly polished, not commercial photography. More natural, candid, and social media friendly.
